\description{Find candidate marker genes for clusters of cells, by testing for differential expression between clusters.}

\usage{
\S4method{findMarkers}{ANY}(x, clusters, design=NULL, pval.type=c("any", "all"),
    direction=c("any", "up", "down"), min.mean=0.1, subset.row=NULL)

\S4method{findMarkers}{SingleCellExperiment}(x, ..., subset.row=NULL, assay.type="logcounts", get.spikes=FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
    A numeric matrix-like object of normalized log-expression values, where each column corresponds to a cell and each row corresponds to an endogenous gene.
    Alternatively, a SingleCellExperiment object containing such a matrix.
}
\item{clusters}{
A vector of cluster identities for all cells.
}
\item{design}{A numeric matrix containing blocking terms, i.e., uninteresting factors driving expression across cells.}
\item{pval.type}{A string specifying the type of combined p-value to be computed, i.e., Simes' or IUT.}
\item{direction}{A string specifying the direction of log-fold changes to be considered for each cluster.}
\item{min.mean}{A numeric scalar specifying the mean threshold for computing empirical Bayes parameters.}
\item{subset.row}{A logical, integer or character scalar indicating the rows of \code{x} to use.}
\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to the matrix method.}
\item{assay.type}{A string specifying which assay values to use, e.g., \code{counts} or \code{logcounts}.}
\item{get.spikes}{A logical scalar specifying whether decomposition should be performed for spike-ins.}
}

\details{
This function uses \pkg{limma} to test for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pairs of clusters.
For each cluster, the log-fold changes and other statistics from all relevant pairwise comparisons are combined into a single table.
A list of such tables is returned for all clusters to define a set of potential marker genes.

Each table is sorted by the \code{Top} value, which specifies the size of the candidate marker set.
Taking all rows with \code{Top} values no greater than some integer X will yield a set containing the top X genes (ranked by significance) from each pairwise comparison.
For example, if X is 5, the set will consist of the \emph{union} of the top 5 genes from each pairwise comparison.
The marker set for each cluster allows it to be distinguished from the other clusters based on the expression of at least one gene.

The \code{FDR} value is calculated by consolidating p-values across contrasts for each gene, and then applying the BH method across genes.
By default, the null hypothesis is that the gene is not DE in any of the contrasts, and Simes' method is used to combine p-values for each gene.
In both cases, the reported value is intended only as a rough measure of significance.
Properly correcting for multiple testing is not generally possible when \code{clusters} is determined from the same \code{x} used for DE testing.

By default, spike-in transcripts are ignored in \code{findMarkers,SingleCellExperiment-method} with \code{get.spikes=FALSE}.
This is overridden by any non-\code{NULL} value of \code{subset.row}.

\section{Tuning the p-value calculations}{
Genes that are uniquely expressed in a cluster are not explicitly favoured by default.
Such a strategy is often too stringent, especially in cases involving overclustering or cell types defined by combinatorial gene expression.
However, if \code{pval.type="all"}, the null hypothesis is that the gene is not DE in all contrasts, and the IUT p-value is computed for each gene.
This can be used to re-rank the genes based on the resulting FDR values.

If \code{direction="any"}, genes will only be ranked based on their p-values, regardless of the direction of the log-fold change.
Otherwise, one-sided tests in the specified direction will be used to compute p-values for each gene in each pairwise comparison.
This can be used to focus on genes that are upregulated in each cluster of interest, which is often easier to interpret.

The application of \pkg{limma} uses the \dQuote{trend} approach on the normalized log-expression values, as described by Law et al. (2015).
This is fast and avoids putting too much weight on outliers or cells with large library sizes.
Empirical Bayes shrinkage is performed separately for genes with means greater or less than \code{min.mean}.
This ensures that discreteness of variances at low counts does not affect other genes, while avoiding the need to discard low-abundance genes entirely.

Uninteresting factors of variation (e.g., preparation time, sequencing batch) will be blocked if they are stored in \code{design}.
Note that the presence of factors that are confounded with \code{clusters} will raise a warning about unestimable coefficients.

\value{
A named list of data frames, where each data frame corresponds to a cluster and contains a ranked set of potential marker genes.
In each data frame, the log-fold change of the cluster against every other cluster Y is also reported, under the column named \code{logFC.Y}.
