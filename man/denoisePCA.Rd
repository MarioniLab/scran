\value{
For \code{getDenoisedPCs}, a list is returned containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{components}, a numeric matrix containing the selected PCs (columns) for all cells (rows).
This has number of columns between \code{min.rank} and \code{max.rank} inclusive.

\code{denoisePCA} will return a modified \code{x} with:
\itemize{
\item the PC results stored in the \code{\link{reducedDims}} as a \code{"PCA"} entry, if \code{type="pca"}.
\item a low-rank approximation as a new \code{"lowrank"} assay, if \code{type="lowrank"}.
This is represented as a \linkS4class{LowRankMatrix}.
}

\code{denoisePCANumber} will return an integer scalar specifying the number of PCs to retain.
This is equivalent to the output from \code{getDenoisedPCs} after setting \code{value="n"}, but ignoring any setting of \code{min.rank} or \code{max.rank}.

\description{
Denoise log-expression data by removing principal components corresponding to technical noise.
}
\details{
This function performs a principal components analysis to eliminate random technical noise in the data.
Random noise is uncorrelated across genes and should be captured by later PCs, as the variance in the data explained by any single gene is low.
In contrast, biological processes should be captured by earlier PCs as more variance can be explained by the correlated behavior of sets of genes in a particular pathway. 
The idea is to discard later PCs to remove noise and improve resolution of population structure.
This also has the benefit of reducing computational work for downstream steps.

The choice of the number of PCs to discard is based on the estimates of technical variance in \code{technical}.
This argument accepts a number of different values, depending on how the technical noise is calculated - this generally involves functions such as \code{\link{modelGeneVarWithSpikes}} or \code{\link{modelGeneVarByPoisson}}.
The percentage of variance explained by technical noise is estimated by summing the technical components across genes and dividing by the summed total variance.
Genes with negative biological components are ignored during downstream analyses to ensure that the total variance is greater than the overall technical estimate. 

Now, consider the retention of the first \eqn{d} PCs.
For a given value of \eqn{d}, we compute the variance explained by all of the later PCs.
We aim to find the smallest value of \eqn{d} such that the sum of variances explained by the later PCs is still less than the variance attributable to technical noise.
This choice of \eqn{d} represents a lower bound on the number of PCs that can be retained before biological variation is definitely lost.
We use this value to obtain a \dQuote{reasonable} dimensionality for the PCA output.

Note that \eqn{d} will be coerced to lie between \code{min.rank} and \code{max.rank}.
This mitigates the effect of occasional extreme results when the percentage of noise is very high or low.
}
\section{Effects of gene selection}{

We can use \code{subset.row} to perform the PCA on a subset of genes of interest.
This is typically used to subset to HVGs to reduce computational time and increase the signal-to-noise ratio of downstream analyses.
Note that only rows with positive components are actually used in the PCA, even if we explicitly specified them in \code{subset.row}.
The final set of genes used in the PCA is returned in \code{used.rows}.

If \code{fill.missing=TRUE}, entries of the rotation matrix are imputed for all genes in \code{x}.
This includes \dQuote{unselected} genes, i.e., with negative biological components or that were not selected with \code{subset.row}.
Rotation vectors are extrapolated to these genes by projecting their expression profiles into the low-dimensional space defined by the SVD on the selected genes.
This is useful for guaranteeing that any low-rank approximation has the same dimensions as the input \code{x}.
For example, calling \code{denoisePCA} with \code{preserve.shape=TRUE} will use \code{fill.missing=TRUE} internally,
which guarantees that any \code{value="lowrank"} setting will be of the same dimensions as the input \code{x}.

Otherwise, if \code{fill.missing=FALSE} and \code{preserve.shape=FALSE}, the output is exactly the same as if the function had been run on \code{x[subset.row,]}.
}

\section{Caveats with interpretation}{

The function's choice of \eqn{d} is only optimal if the early PCs capture all the biological variation with minimal noise.
This is unlikely to be true as the PCA cannot distinguish between technical noise and weak biological signal in the later PCs.
In practice, the chosen \eqn{d} can only be treated as a lower bound for the retention of signal, and it is debatable whether this has any particular relation to the \dQuote{best} choice of the number of PCs.
For example, many aspects of biological variation are not that interesting (e.g., transcriptional bursting, metabolic fluctuations) and it is often the case that we do not need to retain this signal, in which case the chosen \eqn{d} - despite being a lower bound - may actually be higher than necessary.

Interpretation of the choice of \eqn{d} is even more complex if \code{technical} was generated with \code{\link{modelGeneVar}} rather than \code{\link{modelGeneVarWithSpikes}} or \code{\link{modelGeneVarByPoisson}}.
The former includes \dQuote{uninteresting} biological variation in its technical component estimates, increasing the proportion of variance attributed to technical noise and yielding a lower value of \eqn{d}.
Indeed, use of results from \code{\link{modelGeneVar}} often results in \eqn{d} being set to to \code{min.rank}, which can be problematic if secondary factors of biological variation are discarded.

% We could still use modelGeneVar() results as technical= but the outcome is difficult to predict.
% For example, the difference between uninteresting biological variation and technical noise is that the former is not random.
% This means that the assumption that they occupy later PCs may not be entirely true.
% One can easily imagine a situation where fluctuations within a large population take precedence over the variation introduced by a small distinct subpopulation.
