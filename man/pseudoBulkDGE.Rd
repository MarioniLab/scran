\item{x}{A numeric matrix of counts where rows are genes and columns are pseudo-bulk profiles.
Alternatively, a SummarizedExperiment object containing such a matrix in its assays.}

\item{...}{For the generic, additional arguments to pass to individual methods.

\value{
A \linkS4class{List} with one \linkS4class{DataFrame} of DE results per unique (non-failed) level of \code{cluster}.
This contains columns from \code{\link{topTags}} if \code{method="edgeR"} or \code{\link{topTable}} if \code{method="voom"}.
All DataFrames have row names equal to \code{rownames(x)}.

The \code{\link{metadata}} of the List contains \code{failed},
a character vector with the names of the labels for which the comparison could not be performed - see Details.

The \code{\link{metadata}} of the individual DataFrames contains \code{design}, the final design matrix for that label.
If \code{include.intermediates}, the \code{\link{metadata}} will also contain
\code{y}, the DGEList used for the analysis; and \code{fit}, the DGEGLM object after GLM fitting.

\description{
A wrapper function around \pkg{edgeR}'s quasi-likelihood methods
to conveniently perform differential expression analyses on pseudo-bulk profiles,
allowing detection of cell type-specific changes between conditions in replicated studies.
}
\details{
In replicated multi-condition scRNA-seq experiments,
we often have clusters comprised of cells from different samples of different experimental conditions.
It is often desirable to check for differential expression between conditions within each cluster,
allowing us to identify cell-type-specific responses to the experimental perturbation.

Given a set of pseudo-bulk profiles (usually generated by \code{\link{sumCountsAcrossCells}}),
this function loops over the labels and uses \pkg{edgeR} or \code{\link{voom}} to detect DE genes between conditions.
The DE analysis for each label is largely the same as a standard analysis for bulk RNA-seq data,
using \code{design} and \code{coef} or \code{contrast} as described in the \pkg{edgeR} or \pkg{limma} user guides.
Generally speaking, \pkg{edgeR} handles low counts better via its count-based model
but \code{method="voom"} supports variable sample precision when \code{quality=TRUE}.

Performing pseudo-bulk DGE enables us to reuse well-tested methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data analysis.
Each pseudo-bulk profile can be treated as an \emph{in silico} mimicry of a real bulk RNA-seq sample
(though in practice, it tends to be much more variable due to the lower numbers of cells).
This also models the relevant variability between experimental replicates (i.e., across samples) 
rather than that between cells in the same sample, without resorting to expensive mixed-effects models.

The DE analysis for each label is independent of that for any other label.
This aims to minimize problems due to differences in abundance and variance between labels,
at the cost of losing the ability to share information across labels.

In some cases, it will be impossible to perform a DE analysis for a label.
The most obvious reason is if there are no residual degrees of freedom;
other explanations include impossible contrasts or a failure to construct an appropriate design matrix
(e.g., if a cell type only exists in one condition).

Note that we assume that \code{x} has already been filtered to remove unstable pseudo-bulk profiles generated from few cells.

\section{Comments on abundance filtering}{

For each label, abundance filtering is performed using \code{\link{filterByExpr}} prior to further analysis.
Genes that are filtered out will still show up in the DataFrame for that label, but with all statistics set to \code{NA}.
As this is done separately for each label, a different set of genes may be filtered out for each label,
which is largely to be expected if there is any label-specific expression.

By default, the minimum group size for \code{filterByExpr} is determined using the design matrix.
However, this may not be optimal if the design matrix contains additional terms (e.g., blocking factors)
in which case it is not easy to determine the minimum size of the groups relevant to the comparison of interest.
To overcome this, users can specify \code{condition.field} to specify the group to which each sample belongs,
which is used by \code{filterByExpr} to obtain a more appropriate minimum group size.
