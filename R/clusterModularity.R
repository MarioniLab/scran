#' Compute the cluster-wise modularity
#' 
#' Calculate the modularity of each cluster from a graph, based on a null model of random connections between nodes.
#' 
#' @param graph A \link{graph} object from \pkg{igraph}, usually where each node represents a cell.
#' @param clusters Factor specifying the cluster identity for each node.
#' @param get.weights Logical scalar indicating whether the observed and expected edge weights should be returned, rather than the modularity.
#' @param as.ratio Logical scalar indicating whether the log-ratio of observed to expected weights should be returned.
#' 
#' @return
#' By default, an upper triangular numeric matrix of order equal to the number of clusters is returned.
#' Each entry corresponds to a pair of clusters and is proportional to the difference between the observed and expected edge weights between those clusters.
#' 
#' If \code{as.ratio=TRUE}, an upper triangular numeric matrix is again returned.
#' Here, each entry is equal to the ratio between the observed and expected edge weights.
#' 
#' If \code{get.weights=TRUE}, a list is returned containing two upper triangular numeric matrices. 
#' The \code{observed} matrix contains the observed sum of edge weights between and within clusters,
#' while the \code{expected} matrix contains the expected sum of edge weights under the random model.
#' 
#' @details
#' This function computes a modularity score in the same manner as that from \code{\link{modularity}}.
#' The modularity is defined as the (scaled) difference between the observed and expected number of edges between nodes in the same cluster.
#' The expected number of edges is defined by a null model where edges are randomly distributed among nodes.
#' The same logic applies for weighted graphs, replacing the number of edges with the summed weight of edges.
#' 
#' Whereas \code{\link{modularity}} returns a modularity score for the entire graph, \code{clusterModularity} provides scores for the individual clusters.
#' The sum of the diagonal elements of the output matrix should be equal to the output of \code{\link{modularity}} 
#' (after supplying weights to the latter, if necessary).
#' A well-separated cluster should have mostly intra-cluster edges and a high modularity score on the corresponding diagonal entry,
#' while two closely related clusters that are weakly separated will have many inter-cluster edges and a high off-diagonal score.
#'
#' In practice, the modularity may not the most effective metric for evaluating cluster separatedness.
#' This is because the modularity is proportional to the number of cells, so larger clusters will naturally have a large score regardless of separation.
#' An alternative approach is to set \code{as.ratio=TRUE}, which returns the ratio of the observed to expected weights for each entry of the matrix.
#' This adjusts for differences in cluster size and improves resolution of differences between clusters.
#'
#' Directed graphs are treated as undirected inputs with \code{mode="each"} in \code{\link{as.undirected}}.
#' In the rare case that self-loops are present, these will also be handled correctly.
