#' 
#' @details
#' This function performs Wilcoxon rank sum tests to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pairs of groups of cells.
#' A list of tables is returned where each table contains the statistics for all genes for a comparison between each pair of groups.
#' This can be examined directly or used as input to \code{\link{combineMarkers}} for marker gene detection.
#' 
#' The effect size for each gene in each comparison is reported as the area under the curve (AUC).
#' Consider the distribution of expression values for gene X within each of two groups A and B.
#' The AUC is the probability that a randomly selected cell in A has a greater expression of X than a randomly selected cell in B. 
#' (Ties are assumed to be randomly broken.)
#' Concordance probabilities near 0 indicate that most observations in A are lower than most observations in B;
#' conversely, probabilities near 1 indicate that most observations in A are higher than those in B.
#' The Wilcoxon rank sum test effectively tests for significant deviations from an AUC of 0.5.
#' 
#' Wilcoxon rank sum tests are more robust to outliers and insensitive to non-normality, in contrast to t-tests in \code{\link{pairwiseTTests}}.
#' However, they take longer to run, the effect sizes are less interpretable, and there are more subtle violations of its assumptions in real data.
#' For example, the i.i.d. assumptions are unlikely to hold after scaling normalization due to differences in variance.
#' Also note that we approximate the distribution of the Wilcoxon rank sum statistic to deal with large numbers of cells and ties.
#' 
#' If \code{restrict} is specified, comparisons are only performed between pairs of groups in \code{restrict}.
#' This can be used to focus on DEGs distinguishing between a subset of the groups (e.g., closely related cell subtypes).
#'
#' If \code{exclude} is specified, comparisons are not performed between groups in \code{exclude}.
#' Similarly, if any entries of \code{groups} are \code{NA}, the corresponding cells are are ignored.
#' 
#' @section Direction and magnitude of the effect:
#' If \code{direction="any"}, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be performed for each pairwise comparisons between groups of cells.
#' Otherwise, one-sided tests in the specified direction will be used instead.
#' This can be used to focus on genes that are upregulated in each group of interest, which is often easier to interpret.
#' 
#' To interpret the setting of \code{direction}, consider the DataFrame for group X, in which we are comparing to another group Y.
#' If \code{direction="up"}, genes will only be significant in this DataFrame if they are upregulated in group X compared to Y.
#' If \code{direction="down"}, genes will only be significant if they are downregulated in group X compared to Y.
#' See \code{?\link{wilcox.test}} for more details on the interpretation of one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests.
#'
#' Users can also specify a log-fold change threshold in \code{lfc} to focus on genes that exhibit large shifts in location.
#' This is equivalent to specifying the \code{mu} parameter in \code{\link{wilcox.test}}, 
#' with some additional subtleties depending on \code{direction}:
#' \itemize{
#' \item If \code{direction="any"}, the null hypothesis is that the true shift is either \code{-lfc} or \code{lfc} with equal probability.
#' A two-sided p-value is computed against this composite null.
#' The AUC is computed by averaging the AUCs obtained when X's expression values are shifted to the left or right by \code{lfc}.
#' This can be very roughly interpreted as considering an observation of Y to be tied with an observation of X if they differ by less than \code{lfc}.
#' \item If \code{direction="up"}, the null hypothesis is that the true shift is \code{lfc}, and a one-sided p-value is computed.
#' The AUC is computed after shifting X's expression values to the left by \code{lfc}.
#' \item If \code{direction="down"}, the null hypothesis is that the true shift is \code{-lfc}, and a one-sided p-value is computed.
#' The AUC is computed after shifting X's expression values to the right by \code{lfc}.
#' }
#' The fact that the AUC depends on \code{lfc} is necessary to preserve its relationship with the p-value.
#'
#' @section Blocking on uninteresting factors:
#' If \code{block} is specified, Wilcoxon tests are performed between groups of cells within each level of \code{block}.
#' For each pair of groups, the p-values for each gene across all levels of \code{block} are combined using Stouffer's Z-score method.
#' The reported AUC is also a weighted average of the AUCs across all levels.
#' 
#' The weight for a particular level of \code{block} is defined as \eqn{N_xN_y},
#' where \eqn{N_x} and \eqn{N_y} are the number of cells in groups X and Y, respectively, for that level. 
#' This means that p-values from blocks with more cells will have a greater contribution to the combined p-value for each gene.
#' 
#' When combining across batches, one-sided p-values in the same direction are combined first.
#' Then, if \code{direction="any"}, the two combined p-values from both directions are combined.
#' This ensures that a gene only receives a low overall p-value if it changes in the same direction across batches.
#'
#' When comparing two groups, blocking levels are ignored if no p-value was reported, e.g., if there were insufficient cells for a group in a particular level. 
#' If all levels are ignored in this manner, the entire comparison will only contain \code{NA} p-values and a warning will be emitted.
#' 
#' @return 
#' A list is returned containing \code{statistics} and \code{pairs}.
#' 
#' The \code{statistics} element is itself a list of \linkS4class{DataFrame}s.
#' Each DataFrame contains the statistics for a comparison between a pair of groups,
#' including the AUCs, p-values and false discovery rates.
#' 
#' The \code{pairs} element is a DataFrame with one row corresponding to each entry of \code{statistics}.
#' This contains the fields \code{first} and \code{second}, 
#' specifying the two groups under comparison in the corresponding DataFrame in \code{statistics}.
#' 
#' In each DataFrame in \code{statistics}, the AUC represents the probability of sampling a value in the \code{first} group greater than a random value from the \code{second} group.
