#' A List of DataFrames containing marker scores for each gene in each group.
#' Each DataFrame corresponds to a group and each row corresponds to a gene in \code{x}.
#' See Details for information about the individual columns.
#'
#' @details
#' Compared to \code{\link{findMarkers}}, this function represents a simpler and more intuitive summary of the differences between the groups.
#' We do this by realizing that the p-values for these types of comparisons are largely meaningless;
#' individual cells are not meaningful units of experimental replication, while the groups themselves are defined from the data.
#' Thus, by discarding the p-values, we can simplify our marker selection by focusing only on the effect sizes between groups.
#' 
#' Here, the strategy is to perform pairwise comparisons between each pair of groups to obtain various effect sizes.
#' For each group \eqn{X}, we summarize the effect sizes across all pairwise comparisons involving that group, e.g., mean, min, max and so on.
#' This yields a DataFrame for each group where each column contains a different summarized effect and each row corresponds to a gene in \code{x}.
#' Reordering the rows by the summary of choice can yield a ranking of potential marker genes for downstream analyses.
#' 
#' @section Choice of effect sizes:
#' The \code{logFC.cohen} columns contain the standardized log-fold change, i.e., Cohen's d.
#' For each pairwise comparison, this is defined as the difference in the mean log-expression for each group scaled by the average standard deviation across the two groups.
#' (Technically, we should use the pooled variance; however, this introduces some unpleasant asymmetry depending on the variance of the larger group, so we take a simple average instead.)
#' Cohen's d is analogous to the t-statistic in a two-sample t-test and avoids spuriously large effect sizes from comparisons between highly variable groups.
#' We can also interpret Cohen's d as the number of standard deviations between the two group means.
#' 
#' The \code{AUC} columns contain the area under the curve.
#' This is the probability that a randomly chosen observation in one group is greater than a randomly chosen observation in the other group.
#' The AUC is closely related to the U-statistic used in the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
#' Values greater than 0.5 indicate that a gene is upregulated in the first group.
#'
#' The key difference between the AUC and Cohen's d is that the former is less sensitive to the variance within each group.
#' The clearest example is that of two distributions that exhibit no overlap, where the AUC is the same regardless of the variance of each distribution.
#' This may or may not be desirable as it improves robustness to outliers but reduces the information available to obtain a highly resolved ranking. 
#' The most appropriate choice of effect size is left at the user's discretion.
#'
#' Finally, the \code{logFC.detected} columns contain the log-fold change in the proportion of cells with detected (i.e., non-zero) expression between groups.
#' This is specifically useful for detecting binary expression patterns, e.g., activation of an otherwise silent gene.
#' Note that the non-zero status of the data is not altered by normalization, so differences in library size will not be removed when computing this metric.
#' This effect is not necessarily problematic - users can interpret it as \emph{retaining} information about the total RNA content, analogous to spike-in normalization.
#'
#' @section Setting a log-fold change threshold:
#' The default settings may yield highly ranked genes with large effect sizes but low log-fold changes if the variance is low (Cohen's d) or separation is clear (AUC).
#' Such genes may not be particularly interesting as the actual change in expression is modest.
#' Setting \code{lfc} allows us to focus on genes with large log-fold changes between groups,
#' by simply shifting the \dQuote{other} group's expression values by \code{lfc} before computing effect sizes.
#'
#' When \code{lfc} is not zero, Cohen's d is generalized to the standardized difference between the observed log-fold change and \code{lfc}.
#' For example, if we had \code{lfc=2} and we obtained a Cohen's d of 3, this means that the observed log-fold change was 3 standard deviations above a value of 2.
#' A side effect is that we can only unambiguously interpret the direction of Cohen's d when it has the same sign as \code{lfc}.
#' Our above example represents upregulation, but if our Cohen's d was negative, this could either mean downregulation or simply that our observed log-fold change was less than \code{lfc}.
#' 
#' When \code{lfc} is not zero, the AUC is generalized to the probability of obtaining a random observation in one group that is greater than a random observation plus \code{lfc} in the other group.
#' For example, if we had \code{lfc=2} and we obtained an AUC of 0.8, this means that we would observe a difference of \code{lfc} or greater between the random observations.
#' Again, we can only unambiguously interpret the direction of the change when it is the same as the sign of the \code{lfc}.
#' In this case, an AUC above 0.5 with a positive \code{lfc} represents upregulation, but an AUC below 0.5 could mean either downregulation or a log-fold change less than \code{lfc}.
#' 
#' A non-zero setting of \code{lfc} has no effect on the log-fold change in the proportion of cells with detected expression.
#' 
#' @section Computing effect size summaries:
#' To simplify interpretation, we summarize the effect sizes across all pairwise comparisons into a few key metrics.
#' For each group \eqn{X}, we consider the effect sizes from all pairwise comparisons between \eqn{X} and other groups. 
#' We then compute the following values:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{mean.*}, the mean effect size across all pairwise comparisons involving \eqn{X}.
#' A large value (>0 for log-fold changes, >0.5 for the AUCs) indicates that the gene is upregulated in \eqn{X} compared to the average of the other groups.
#' A small value (<0 for the log-fold changes, <0.5 for the AUCs) indicates that the gene is downregulated in \eqn{X} instead.
#' \item \code{median.*}, the median effect size across all pairwise comparisons involving \eqn{X}.
#' A large value indicates that the gene is upregulated in \eqn{X} compared to most (>50\%) other groups.
#' A small value indicates that the gene is downregulated in \eqn{X} instead.
#' \item \code{min.*}, the minimum effect size across all pairwise comparisons involving \eqn{X}.
#' A large value indicates that the gene is upregulated in \eqn{X} compared to all other groups.
#' A small value indicates that the gene is downregulated in \eqn{X} compared to at least one other group.
#' \item \code{max.*}, the maximum effect size across all pairwise comparisons involving \eqn{X}.
#' A large value indicates that the gene is upregulated in \eqn{X} compared to at least one other group.
#' A small value indicates that the gene is downregulated in \eqn{X} compared to all other groups.
#' \item \code{rank.*}, the minimum rank (i.e., \dQuote{min-rank}) across all pairwise comparisons involving \eqn{X} - see \code{?\link{computeMinRank}} for details.
#' A small min-rank indicates that the gene is one of the top upregulated genes in at least one comparison to another group.
#' }
#' One set of these columns is added to the DataFrame for each effect size described above.
#' For example, the mean column for the AUC would be \code{mean.AUC}.
#' We can then reorder each group's DataFrame by our column of choice, depending on which summary and effect size we are interested in.
#' For example, if we ranked by decreasing \code{min.logFC.detected}, we would be aiming for marker genes that exhibit strong binary increases in expression in \eqn{X} compared to \emph{all} other groups.
#' 
#' If \code{full.stats=TRUE}, an extra \code{full.*} column is returned in the DataFrame.
#' This contains a nested DataFrame with number of columns equal to the number of other groups.
#' Each column contains the statistic from the comparison between \eqn{X} and the other group.
#'
#' Keep in mind that the interpretations above also depend on the sign of \code{lfc}.
#' The concept of a \dQuote{large} summary statistic (>0 for Cohen's d, >0.5 for the AUCs) can only be interpreted as upregulation when \code{lfc >= 0}.
#' Similarly, the concept of a \dQuote{small} value (<0 for Cohen's d, <0.5 for the AUCs) cannot be interpreted as downregulation when \code{lfc <= 0}.
#' For example, if \code{lfc=1}, a positive \code{min.logFC.cohen} can still be interpreted as upregulation in \eqn{X} compared to all other groups,
#' but a negative \code{max.logFC.cohen} could not be interpreted as downregulation in \eqn{X} compared to all other groups.
#'
#' @section Computing other descriptive statistics: 
#' We report the mean log-expression of all cells in \eqn{X}, as well as the grand mean of mean log-expression values for all other groups.
#' This is purely descriptive; while it can be used to compute an overall log-fold change, ranking is best performed on one of the effect sizes described above.
#' We also report the proportion of cells with detectable expression in \eqn{X} and the mean proportion for all other groups.
#'
#' When \code{block} is specified, the reported mean for each group is computed via \code{\link{correctGroupSummary}}. 
#' Briefly, this involves fitting a linear model to remove the effect of the blocking factor from the per-group mean log-expression.
#' The same is done for the detected proportion, except that the values are subjected to a logit transformation prior to the model fitting.
#' In both cases, each group/block combination is weighted by its number of cells in the model.
#'
#' @section Controlling the pairings:
#' The \code{pairings} argument specifies the pairs of groups that should be compared.
#' This can be:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{NULL}, in which case comparisons are performed between all groups in \code{groups}.
#' \item A vector of the same type as \code{group}, specifying a subset of groups of interest.
#' We then perform all pairwise comparisons between groups in the subset.
#' \item A list of two vectors, each of the same type as \code{group} and specifying a subset of groups.
#' Comparisons are performed between one group from the first vector and another group from the second vector.
#' \item A matrix of two columns of the same type as \code{group}.
#' Each row is assumed to specify a pair of groups to be compared.
#' }
#' 
#' Effect sizes (and their summaries) are computed for only the pairwise comparisons specified by \code{pairings}.
#' Similarly, the \code{other.*} values in \eqn{X}'s DataFrame are computed using only the groups involved in pairwise comparisons with \eqn{X}.
#' The default of \code{pairings=NULL} ensures that all groups are used and effect sizes for all pairwise comparisons are reported;
#' however, this may not be the case for other values of \code{pairings}.
#' 
#' For list and matrix arguments, the first vector/column is treated as the first group in the effect size calculations.
#' Statistics for each comparison will only show up in the DataFrame for the first group, 
#' i.e., a comparison between \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} will have a valid \code{full.AUC$Y} field in \eqn{X}'s DataFrame but not vice versa.
#' If both directions are desired in the output, both of the corresponding permutations should be explicitly specified in \code{pairings}.
