Title: Methods for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Analysis
Description: 
    Implements functions for low-level analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data. 
    Methods are provided for normalization of cell-specific biases, assignment of cell cycle phase, 
    detection of highly variable and significantly correlated genes, identification of marker genes, 
    and other common tasks in routine single-cell analysis workflows.
