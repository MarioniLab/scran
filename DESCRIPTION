Description: Implements functions for low-level analyses of single-cell 
        RNA-seq data. Methods are provided for normalization of 
        cell-specific biases, assignment of cell cycle phase, 
        detection of highly variable and significantly correlated genes,
        correction of batch effects, identification of marker genes,
        and other common tasks in single-cell analysis workflows.
