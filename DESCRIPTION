Title: Methods for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Analysis
Description: 
    Implements miscellaneous functions for interpretation of single-cell RNA-seq data.
    Methods are provided for assignment of cell cycle phase, detection of highly
    variable and significantly correlated genes, identification of marker genes,
    and other common tasks in routine single-cell analysis workflows.
